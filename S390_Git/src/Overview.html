The s390 suite is concerned with analysing quasar spectra from the
<a href="https://www.sdss3.org/dr10/algorithms/qso_catalog.php">DR10Q</a> quasar
catalogue of the <a href="https://www.sdss3.org/">SDSS</a> 10th data release.

The suite contains processing for loading DR10Q data and spectrum FITS tables
 onto databases for processing. It has facilities for shifting, rebinning and
 normalising quasar spectra, and combining them into high SNR composites.
